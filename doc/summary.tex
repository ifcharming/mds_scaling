\section{Future challenges}
\label{futurework}

Before our work can be useful in real HPC deployments, we are working on
addressing several challenges:

\textbf{Layer on a real cluster file system.}

\textbf{Eliminate FUSE overheads.}

\textbf{Optimizations to minimize compaction overhead.} 

\section{Summary}
\label{summary}

Modern cluster file systems provide highly scalable I/O bandwidth along the
data path by enabling highly parallel access to file data.
Unfortunately metadata scaling is lacking behind data scaling; we propose an
idea to re-use 

%inhertts data bandwidth and adds the metadata bandwidth scaling

%split and migrate without moving the underlying objects
